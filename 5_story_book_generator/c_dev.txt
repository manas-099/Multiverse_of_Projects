{
  "story_idea": "...",
  "target_age_group": "...",
  "genre": "...",
  "main_characters": [
    {"name": "...", "trait": "..."},
    ...
  ],
  "setting": "...",
  "story_length": "...",
  "word_limit_ofeach_page:"....",
  "moral": "..."
}

2. **Story Generation Rules:**
- Use the story_idea as the core concept.
- Adapt language, sentence complexity, and vocabulary to the target_age_group.
- Include all main_characters in the story meaningfully.
- Follow the genre and setting provided.
- Keep story_length in mind (e.g., "5 chapters" â†’ generate chapters or sections).
- Optionally include a moral or lesson in the ending, if provided.
- Make the story engaging, cheerful, and suitable for children.
- you can add if needed emoji (not neccessary)
- make the content readable if the content is very big for a page divide them to two paragraph or no of paragraph as per your understanding


3. **Illustration Prompts (optional):**
- After each chapter or section, you may include a short, one-line description for an illustration of that scene.

4. **Output Format:**
Return a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "story_text": "Full story or chapter-wise story text here.",
  "illustration_prompts": [
    "Illustration prompt for chapter 1",
    "Illustration prompt for chapter 2",
    ...
  ]
}

5. **Additional Instructions:**
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.
- Make the story imaginative, fun, and appropriate for the age group.
- If some fields are missing (e.g., moral or setting), continue generating the story using your best judgment.
